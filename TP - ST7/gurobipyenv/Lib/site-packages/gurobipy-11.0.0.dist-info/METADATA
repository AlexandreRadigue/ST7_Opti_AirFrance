The Gurobi Optimizer is a mathematical optimization software library
for solving mixed-integer linear and quadratic optimization problems.

This package comes with a trial license that allows you to solve
problems of limited size.  As a student or staff member of an academic
institution you qualify for a free, full product license. For
more information, see:

* https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/

For a commercial evaluation, you can `request an evaluation license`_.

A simple example
----------------

.. code::

  # Solve the following MIP:
  #  maximize
  #        x +   y + 2 z
  #  subject to
  #        x + 2 y + 3 z <= 4
  #        x +   y       >= 1
  #        x, y, z binary

  import gurobipy as gp

  # Create a new model
  m = gp.Model()

  # Create variables
  x = m.addVar(vtype='B', name="x")
  y = m.addVar(vtype='B', name="y")
  z = m.addVar(vtype='B', name="z")

  # Set objective function
  m.setObjective(x + y + 2 * z, gp.GRB.MAXIMIZE)

  # Add constraints
  m.addConstr(x + 2 * y + 3 * z <= 4)
  m.addConstr(x + y >= 1)

  # Solve it!
  m.optimize()

  print(f"Optimal objective value: {m.objVal}")
  print(f"Solution values: x={x.X}, y={y.X}, z={z.X}")
